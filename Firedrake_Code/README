This folder contains firedrake setup and solver for the "simple model" for w (equaiton 6.1) 
Below are useful documents and instructions to setup firedrake locally: 

Numerical Modeling with Firedrake 
User Setup: 
On macOS it is important that homebrew and Xcode are installed and up to date and that the homebrew-installed Python is used instead of the system one. At present I list the steps below required for installation on MacOS, if you are using Linux refer to online installation requirements. 
Installing Firedrake w/ Homebrew : 
1.	Follow the steps to install homebrew locally (https://brew.sh/) 
a.	This will create a local homebrew folder “opt/homebrew/” 
2.	Install venv for virtual environment management via “brew install virtualenv” 
3.	Create a firedrake virtual environment in the desired folder using virtualenv firedrake 
a.	For me I’ve created location “opt/homebrew/envs/firedrake” 
4.	Activate your new environment via “source opt/homebrew/envs/firedrake /bin/activate” 
At this point follow directions indicated here (https://www.firedrakeproject.org/install.html#) for ease the required steps are also listed below
5.	Execute
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/refs/tags/2025.4.2/scripts/firedrake-configure

6.	Execute 
brew install $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-system-packages)
7.	Install PETSc and check installation using : 
$ git clone --branch $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-petsc-version) https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git
$ cd petsc

$ python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options | xargs -L1 ./configure
make PETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc PETSC_ARCH=arch-firedrake-default all

$ make check
$ cd ..


Now we can install Firedrake: 
8.	Purge your pip cache 
$ pip cache purge
9.	Set firedrake flags
$ export $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-env)
10.	 Install firedrake (finally!) 
$ pip install --no-binary h5py 'firedrake[check]'
11.	Check the installation 
$ firedrake-check
